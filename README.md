# PHP: Unexpected Array Order and Loose Type Comparison Issues

This repository demonstrates two subtle yet common issues in PHP: inconsistent array key ordering and unexpected behavior with loose type comparisons.

## Array Key Order Inconsistency

PHP does not guarantee the order of array elements, especially when mixing string and integer keys.  This can lead to errors if you depend on a specific order during array traversal.

## Loose Type Comparisons

PHP's loose type comparisons can lead to unpredictable behavior.  Comparing a string '0' to an integer 0 might yield unexpected results.

The provided code examples showcase these issues and demonstrate how to mitigate them.
